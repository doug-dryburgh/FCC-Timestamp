    <h1>FCC - Timestamp Microservice</h1>
    <p>This project has the following user stories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).</li>
        <li>If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.</li>
        <li>If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.</li>
    </ul>
